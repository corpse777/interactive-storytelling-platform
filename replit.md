# Interactive Storytelling Platform

## Overview

This is a modern interactive storytelling platform built with React, TypeScript, Express.js, and PostgreSQL. The application provides a comprehensive platform for reading, writing, and sharing interactive stories with user authentication, content management, and administrative features.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components and Radix UI primitives
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state, React Query for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **UI Components**: Custom components built on Radix UI with accessibility features

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication with bcryptjs password hashing
- **Security**: CSRF protection, rate limiting, CORS configuration, Helmet security headers
- **API Design**: RESTful API with JSON responses

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Authentication, profiles, admin roles
- **Posts**: Stories with categories, tags, metadata, reading time
- **Comments**: Threaded comments system
- **Bookmarks**: User bookmarking functionality
- **Categories & Tags**: Content organization
- **Site Settings**: Application configuration

## Key Components

### Content Management
- WordPress API integration for automatic content synchronization
- Admin content creation and editing interface
- Community post submission system
- Content categorization (Horror, Supernatural, etc.)
- Reading time calculation and progress tracking

### User Management
- User registration and authentication
- Profile management with customizable settings
- Admin user management interface
- Role-based access control

### Reader Experience
- Responsive reading interface with font size controls
- Dark/light theme support
- Progress tracking and bookmarking
- Interactive elements and animations
- Mobile-optimized navigation

### Administrative Features
- Consolidated admin menu with 4 main sections:
  - Dashboard
  - Content Management (Stories, Content, WordPress Sync)
  - User Management (Users, Moderation)
  - Insights & Reports (Analytics, Statistics, Feedback, Bug Reports)

## Data Flow

### Content Synchronization
1. WordPress API automatically syncs content every 5 minutes
2. Local storage fallback for offline functionality
3. Server-side API as secondary fallback
4. Real-time content updates through proper cache invalidation

### Authentication Flow
1. Session-based authentication with secure cookies
2. CSRF protection on all state-changing operations
3. Rate limiting for authentication endpoints
4. Automatic session renewal and cleanup

### API Request Flow
1. Client requests include CSRF tokens automatically
2. Rate limiting applied based on user authentication status
3. Error handling with proper user feedback
4. Automatic retry logic for failed requests

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **React Ecosystem**: React, React DOM, React Query
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand, React Hook Form
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL driver
- **Authentication**: bcryptjs, express-session
- **Security**: helmet, express-rate-limit, CORS
- **Validation**: Zod for schema validation

### Enhanced Features
- **Animations**: Framer Motion, React Confetti
- **Typography**: React Simple Typewriter, React Scramble
- **Icons**: Lucide React, React Icons
- **Analytics**: PostHog for user behavior tracking
- **Performance**: Web Vitals monitoring

## Deployment Strategy

### Split Deployment Architecture
- **Frontend**: Deployed on Vercel for optimal React/Vite performance
- **Backend**: Deployed on Render for Node.js/Express API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL hosted on Neon for serverless scaling
- **Assets**: Static assets served through Vercel's CDN

### Environment Configuration
- Cross-domain CORS setup for frontend-backend communication
- Secure cookie configuration for cross-domain authentication
- Environment-specific rate limiting and security settings
- Database connection pooling for production scalability

### Security Considerations
- HTTPS enforcement for all cross-domain communications
- SameSite=None cookies for cross-domain session management
- IP whitelisting for development environments
- Comprehensive rate limiting strategy

## Database Setup

### Automatic Database Initialization
- **Modern Commands**: Updated to use current Drizzle Kit commands with fallback compatibility
- **Startup Integration**: Database setup runs automatically on every application start
- **Direct Connection**: Bypasses command-line tool issues with direct database connection verification
- **Admin User Creation**: Automatically creates default admin user (username: admin, password: admin123)
- **Environment Detection**: Adapts to Replit and other deployment environments
- **Graceful Degradation**: Application starts even if database setup encounters issues

### Database Scripts Available
- `scripts/direct-db-setup.ts` - Direct database connection and table verification
- `scripts/permanent-startup.ts` - Comprehensive startup routine for all environments
- `db-setup.js` - Node.js fallback script with multiple Drizzle command attempts
- `DATABASE_SETUP.md` - Complete documentation for database setup process

## Content Management

### Sample Story Removal
- **Clean WordPress Content**: Removed all sample/demo stories from reader and database
- **WordPress API Only**: Reader now displays only authentic content from WordPress API
- **Database Cleanup**: Removed 3 sample stories ("Welcome to Our Digital Storytelling Platform", "The Art of Interactive Storytelling", "Building Your First Interactive Story")
- **Current Content**: 21 WordPress stories with titles like "BLOOD", "WORD", "HUNGER", etc.
- **Automated Script**: Created `scripts/remove-sample-stories.ts` for future cleanup if needed

### Content Sources
- **Primary**: WordPress API (bubbleteameimei.wordpress.com) - automatically synced every 5 minutes
- **Secondary**: Community posts from authenticated users
- **Removed**: All sample/demo/placeholder content
